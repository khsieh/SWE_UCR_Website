Some of the aspects I have been involved with include being a member of the SSED Planning Committee for outreach; attending the ASUCR budget meetings for the treasury; supporting and being a part of the sports teams for social; and participating in conferences for professional.

		In addition to being very much involved in the planning and execution of SWE events, I am well informed about current BCOE events by being a member of the Leadership Council. The meetings held by the Leadership Council allow for club officers to be aware of college-wide events planned and held by the other BCOE organizations. As vice president, I would ensure that SWE members are informed about these events in addition to the events hosted by SWE. I would also emphasize the importance of recruiting and retaining members by working to appeal to members of all backgrounds. Doing so would not only benefit current members, but would benefit the future generations of SWE members as well. Additionally, I would be able to assist the other officers with their respective duties due to my past experience in the club, as well as allocate and enforce these duties among the officers. My dedication to SWE allows for me to be able to successfully become acting president if need be.

		I have been involved with SWE for the past two years. Throughout those two years I have participated and attended many meetings and events hosted by SWE. I feel that I would be a good candidate for Social Chair, because I have not just attended the socials, but I have also had the chance to work behind the scenes. Whenever given the chance, I would help the current Social Chairs with whatever was needed for their events, the most recent being the Valentine's Day Auction. I helped set up, prepare the music and movie, and did whatever was needed. Other than the socials, I helped out at the BCOE banquet and am currently involved in the planning of the Bourns Engineering Day. I have seen what goes on in the making of such events and know what one should do in order to make them successful. If elected as Social Chair, I believe that I can continue to make new and old members feel welcomed at all the meetings and socials that SWE prepares. I also know that with my hard work and determination, I will be able to plan new social events that everyone can enjoy.	</td>

		SWE has helped me to be more involved on campus and has opened me to a community of people that have similar goals to mine. I want to help with these goals by assisting SWE members to be better prepared after graduation. As the Professional Development Chair, I will search for the best speakers to inspire the members of SWE. I will provide good communication with Career Center so that our members can take full advantage of the professional activities on campus. I know that college is not only about education and experience but networking as well. I want to communicate was outside organizations so that our members can meet people that can provide them with support and assistance in their careers.

		As the Professional Development Chair, it is my duty to inform others of the activities and workshops the Career Center
		offers. I have attended multiple Career Center affiliated events, such as the Career Fair and resume workshops, and have
		access to the Career Center calendar. I will keep others up to date about opportunities that are beneficial for them and their
		career. As I have become more active in the engineering community, I have come to know different faculty from across the
		disciplines. I have recently had the opportunity to meet with graduate professor Dr. Ozkan through SWE’s weekly coffee with
		the professor. I want to expand opportunities like this to the rest of the SWE community. By attending spring officer training
		this year, I have been able to become active within SWE Orange County Section. I have signed up to volunteer at their events
		and to attend the Professional Development Conference. I also will be attending the Regional Conference 2013 and I am a
		part of the Career Fair committee planning the Regional Conference 2014. Through the connections I make there, I hope to
		bring back more guest speakers and career opportunities for SWE@UCR.

		As the Professional Development Chair I would make sure that SWE members receive various workshops that will allow them to be prepared for whatever comes their ways. Whether it is internships or research opportunities, I will make sure that SWE has the correct workshops that will help them gain whatever position it is they are trying to achieve. I will make sure that SWE is widely known and is tightly connected to the Career Center. I have used the Career center a couple of times before, so I know how things are done on that side. Also, being an active member of other engineering clubs, I want to use the connections to allow SWE to network not just to recruiters and professors but also to other future engineers.

		I would love to be the Historian for SWE because this organization is a great help for the future of engineering and I want to capture this.

I know what it means to capture moments that will forever affect the lives of people and the organization. I am good with a camera, I enjoy photography, so I will make sure to capture moments the way that they should be captured. I will be glad to work with the SWE Webmaster to help visitors of our webpage know about SWE and encourage them to get involved. I will attend all events to capture each moment and will assist the rest of the officers when needed. 	</font>

		current League of Legends tournament, and the group’s media. I believe I can use these skills in managing 
		SWE’s Facebook page and website. My life goals include becoming a superb programmer, and so I want to
