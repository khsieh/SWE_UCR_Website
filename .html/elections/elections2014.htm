		As the social coordinator for this year, my goal was to bring everyone into the SWE family and be inclusive. I feel like 
		this goal has had major progress in our chapter. We have many members and cross-organization activities that open up our 
		aisles of communication.  By being the Social Coordinator, I have had that experience managing and working with others. 
		By being involved in many of the different events, I feel like I have the most information to offer regarding SWE activities.  
		I also been involved in SWE on a section with SWE-OC and national level being a SWE-Future Leader.  This gives me great 
		insight into how other chapter presidents operate and how the society works as a whole.
		     <br><br>
		I am the best candidate for this position because I am involved in SWE at various levels. I have the background necessary 
		to direct the future officers should anything be needed. There are so many ideas and things that I want to implement in 
		SWE for this upcoming year.  One of which is getting more freshmen involved. After speaking with several SWE peers, I 
		can see where we can improve and have obtain many new ways to accomplish that.
		SWE has allowed me to grow as a leader, I can say confidently that I am not the same person I was when I first picked up 
		this position. I know where my flaws lie and I have made progress to improve myself as a leader.  As president of SWE, I 
		wish to stimulate this growth in our upcoming board as well. I believe that if our leaders grow, the members will follow 
		in suit.

		I have been an active member of SWE for the past 3 years, since the beginning of my freshman year here at UCR. As a freshman, 
		I was able to experience the wide array of programs and events that SWE@UCR has diligently offered. From developing my 
		professional network (through forums such as JPL's Leaders in Space Exploration), to community and STEM outreach (like 
		the installation of solar panels with Grid Alternatives and participation in the SSED committee), SWE had definitely 
		impacted me with its core values and mission. At the turn of my sophomore year I had the opportunity to join the executive 
		SWE board at our Riverside section. As Webmaster, I was able to further develop my appreciation for SWE and was able to 
		experience working with the driving force behind SWE@UCR. Being on the board allowed me to gain more exposure to what it 
		takes to work in a team, and I've learned how to identify personal interaction styles and adapt accordingly. In addition 
		to actively working with other board members to maintain and carry out successful programs and events, I attended 
		conferences and webinars that catered to my own professional development. I continued contributing to the SWE board my 
		third year as Ambassador, and was identified as a SWEFL. As a SWEFL, I was put through leadership training and a new 
		frontier of resources was made available to me. I have also completed leadership conferences and workshops outside of 
		SWE, all of which have allowed me to tend to keeping an open perspective and moreover appreciate the value of diversity. 
		I also have experience working on teams in community projects (e.g. IEEE Display Board Project, head of hardware and UAV, 
		individual contributor-image processing) as well as my Dual-Axis Tracking System project (head of software) for my internship 
		at CE-CERT. I believe that the experience I have in working with teams alongside the leadership opportunities I have undertaken 
		make me qualified for this position. <br><br>
		In addition to all of the experience I have working with others in a team, I also possess skills essential to 
		effectively manage a team. I am able to identify how people interact with each other, and adapt and provide for them 
		as needbe. As president, I would foster an environment that is open to feedback and communication. I believe that a 
		successful leader not only administers a team, but alleviates tasks and workload through offering the appropriate tools 
		and resources. I believe that it is my dedication to not only to the SWE@UCR board but the mission of the organization 
		as a whole that makes me the best candidate for this position.

	  good job organizing advisor meetings and setting up carpools to conferences. Lastly, this year I have always tried to help
	   out other officers when they ask for help and I have been able to help. <br><br>
	Outside of my own responsibilities as Outreach, I have tried this year to help other officers and events whenever I can and 
	when they need an extra hand. I think that I have also demonstrated this past year as an officer that if I can work effectively 
	with other officers and members of SWE. I think that I have learned a lot of useful leadership skills going from a committee 
	member, to an officer, and I'd like to take that even further to apply those skills and expand on them as VP.

		In high school, I was a treasurer of two organizations and gained experience working as a team. The treasure position was 
		mostly just handling the money and planning fundraisers. Most of the time I had to work with the other officers about how 
		to we would bring in more money into our organizations and how this money would be divided throughout the years. Therefore, 
		I had to be able to work well with everyone because if we wanted an event to happen we all had to work together to make it happen. <br><br>
		I don't have much experience for this position but I have always found myself to be a leader. I love to help people and 
		I work well with others. I would also work hard so that events/ meetings ran smoothly. I find that I can clearly view 
		both sides of a situation, if there was ever an issue, and would be able to an objective decision that would be best 
		for the organization.

		I've been a SWE member since my freshman year. Through the years being a SWE member, I've been attending various SWE

		for this school year, I learned lots of things about treasury. Now, I feel like I know what I should do as a treasurer 
		and I am confident. <br><br>
		As a current SWE treasurer, I experienced lots of things related to treasury. I learned it required a huge 
		responsibility than I thought because I was the one who was in charge of money. Also, I learned that there 
		are lots of rules and policies that I had to go through in order to get reimbursement and to organize fundraisers. 
		Through this year as a treasurer, I tried to work hard to get all things done well while I was learning about how 
		things worked. And from this experience, I also learned things that I should have done or I shouldn't have done. 
		This made me better and better and taught what to do and how to do. Therefore, I'd like to continue this in order 
		to improve and to make things more organized through skills that I learned this year. I believe that I can do work 
		more efficiently next year with all these experiences.

		I have been a part of Bourns Engineering Day since my freshman year. This Spring will be my third year with the 
		event. As a freshman and sophomore I worked on the Activities side of the event so I know how that part of the 
		event works. Then this year, I have learned everything else that goes into running this event smoothly. I've 
		been able to do some of the tasks myself, and others I have shared with my co-chair or delegated to the committee 
		members. One of the main things I've done this year is communicate with schools that have had questions about 
		Engineering Day. I think that these contacts will be a good way for us to find other outreach opportunities at 
		these schools during other quarters. <br><br>
		I think I make a good candidate for this position because so far I have been successful at my position so far this

		I have had leadership and administrative experience in the past that I believe will help me be an asset to SWE. 
		In my senior year of high school I was president of my school's chapter of Future Business Leaders of America. 
		As president I had to learn to manage everyone effectively, take care of administrative tasks like paperwork to 
		maintain the club, advertise effectively, and make sure all our activities went according to plan. I also gained 
		experience creatively coming up with events that would both benefit our members and even the community.<br>
		Other experience I have had includes being a reporter for the Northern California chapter of Junior Statesmen of 
		America. I wrote for the organization's monthly newsletter recapping events that happened that month or hot 
		topics that were being debated on at the time.  I also had the chance to interview various people in the 
		organization and write a variety of articles. <br>
		Most recently I had the experience of being on the Bourns Engineering Day committee and helping with the activities 
		portion of planning. I was involved in with choosing which activities should be included and finding 
		instructions for each of the activities. Being part of the committee allowed me to see and experience the 
		planning that goes into Engineering Day.
		<br><br>
		I believe I am the best candidate for the positions I have applied for not only because I have experience in 
		these areas, but also because I think I have the qualities that people in these positions need. I am a detailed 
		oriented person and a meticulous note taker, which is why I think I would be a good secretary. I am also organized, 
		good with numbers, and responsible with managing money which are important qualities towards being treasurer. 
		Furthermore I enjoy planning and organizing events, and contributing creative and fun ideas -- qualities I 
		think are important to the social and outreach positions. I also posses strong writing skills, and enjoy 
		writing editorial pieces, making me a good candidate for Historian/Newsletter Editor. Additionally, I have 
		had lots of experience advertising and am well versed in social media, allowing me to be a good fit for webmaster/PR.<br>
		Finally, I am very supportive of SWE's mission to get more girls involved in the the area of engineering and 
		unify UCR's community of female engineers. I think women need encouragement and support in the field of 
		engineering, which is why I would like to be part of SWE and contribute to the organizations mission.

		I have had leadership and administrative experience in the past that I believe will help me be an asset to SWE. 
		In my senior year of high school I was president of my school's chapter of Future Business Leaders of America. 
		As president I had to learn to manage everyone effectively, take care of administrative tasks like paperwork to 
		maintain the club, advertise effectively, and make sure all our activities went according to plan. I also gained 
		experience creatively coming up with events that would both benefit our members and even the community.<br>
		Other experience I have had includes being a reporter for the Northern California chapter of Junior Statesmen of 
		America. I wrote for the organization's monthly newsletter recapping events that happened that month or hot 
		topics that were being debated on at the time.  I also had the chance to interview various people in the 
		organization and write a variety of articles. <br>
		Most recently I had the experience of being on the Bourns Engineering Day committee and helping with the activities

		Furthermore I enjoy planning and organizing events, and contributing creative and fun ideas -- qualities I

		had lots of experience advertising and am well versed in social media, allowing me to be a good fit for webmaster/PR.<br>
		Finally, I am very supportive of SWE's mission to get more girls involved in the the area of engineering and 
		unify UCR's community of female engineers. I think women need encouragement and support in the field of 
		engineering, which is why I would like to be part of SWE and contribute to the organizations mission.

		Finally, I am very supportive of SWE's mission to get more girls involved in the the area of engineering and 
		unify UCR's community of female engineers. I think women need encouragement and support in the field of 
		engineering, which is why I would like to be part of SWE and contribute to the organizations mission.
