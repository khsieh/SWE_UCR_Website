  Date: 5/11/2005 6pm<br>
  Location: The Barn<br>
  Attendance: 16 members and 6 guests: Linda O'Neill, Professor Sharon Walker, Professor Mihri Ozkan, Dean Mark Matsumoto, Tammy Qutami, Dr. Kawai Tam</p>
                                    <p>Description:<br>
  SWE at UCR wrapped up a full year of activities, opportunities, and involvement with its annual banquet in The Barn. Members and guests enjoyed excellent food, good company, and an interesting program. First on the agenda was a keynote speech by Dean Matsumoto about the history of Bourns College of Engineering and its accomplishments, impressing attendees with how far the college has come in its short history (and validating their experience of its rigorousness!). Next President Cynthia Carter gave a summary of SWE's events and achievements over the past year, congratulated graduating seniors in attendance, recognized SWE officers, and gave out gifts and awards: a gift to Dean Matsumoto for being kind enough to address SWE's banquet; a gift and congratulations to SWE advisor Mihri Ozkan for her recent outstanding honor from the American Association of University Women; a welcome gift to Sharon Walker as a new SWE advisor; a thank you gift to Linda O'Neill for all she has done for SWE and the COE over the past year; and a prize to Jennifer Jones for being SWE's outstanding member of the year. </p>
                                    <p> Special thanks to events coordinator Melissa Mangahas for organizing and setting up the banquet!</p>                                  </td>

Tour stops included the JPL museum, Space Flight Operations Facility, Team X Project Design Center, Robotics laboratory, Micro Devices laboratory, and In Situ Instruments Laboratory. Attendees were also privy to special sessions with young women engineers who are members of Team X, a group that specializes in designing and planning proposed space missions, and a demonstration of robots that may in the future be used to construct habitats on the moon. The excitement of the engineers about their jobs was apparent in every one with whom we spoke, and each seemed convinced that they have &quot;the coolest job on the planet.&quot; Mr. Hammon's extensive knowledge and interest in JPL's various centers and projects, as well as his efforts to put together a special tour on our behalfs, made for an enthralling day for all involved. A special thank you to Linda O'Neill and Art Hammon for arranging the amazing tour!</p>

                                    <p>- new RSR Alison Bourke, new newsletter eds Lisa Dakis and Ben Maher<br>
  - we really need to turn in blurbs/pics for regional newsletter<br>
  - also each section is expected to turn in quarterly reports and apply for outstanding section<br>
  - president of past outstanding section suggested basing goals at the beginning of each quarter/year on the mission in the OSS guidelines (goals defined by SWE), documenting everything, looking at past winners' reports online<br>
  - Student Activities Committee (SAC) is being restructured to focus less on administrative work...more info on the swe site.<br>
  - next year RSR/newsletter editor voting will be different, possibly online voting in advance of the convention, with the winner being announced at the convention<br>
  - student positions are available on national committees and in regional leadership positions, applications are encouraged, look online<br>
  - vitality reps are available to come and do leadership coaching and training (see brochure)<br>
  - we are asked to donate to travel expenses of RSR and student BOD rep (see form)<br>
  - kaplan is offering SWE a discount on test prep materials for the FE exam, which all engineers are encouraged to take (see material)</p>
                                    <p>Christine's convention experience:<br>
&quot;My experience at the SWE Regional Convention was one of fun and somewhat helpful. I attended panels like planning for your future, how to pick the best job offer, and women in the engineering (in which I learned a lot of funny statistics). If I needed to find a job, the Regional Convention would have been a great place to spend my time. During the student members meeting each school colored their own puzzle piece in their own way and then we put the pieces together.&quot;</p>

  Date: 3/2/2005<br>
  Location: Irvine<br>
  Attendance: Shylah</p>
                                    <p align="left"> On March 2nd, University of California, Irvine hosted their annual SWE Networking night. It was a gathering of guest engineers and technical workers from top companies and university students to eat dinner together, and also network during the dinner and participating in a set of networking groups thereafter. UCR SWE students sat with different engineering representatives, from engineers at Boeing to developers at Qualcomm. Other companies that attended the networking night included Unisys, Boeing, Parker Aerospace, MSC Software, Edward Life Science, and many more. It was during the serving of dinner that engineering representatives gave tips on surviving in a corporate environment, as well as appropriate courses to take for success in engineering. As dinner was served, UC Irvine gave recognition to sponsors of the event, and several guest speakers spoke of women in engineering, as well as how we are succeeding in the change of technology. After the speakers, the event then ended with an optional networking opportunity, as many companies that participated in the event took resumes and spoke with students, as well as gave tips on structuring their resumes and contacting company representatives for other networking opportunities.</p>

Panelists spoke about their motivations for becoming scientists or engineers, obstacles they have faced along the way, balancing their careers and their lives, advice for those considering science or engineering, and many other subjects in a lively and insightful discussion. Audience members listened in fascination to many quips and tidbits from the wide variety of experiences of the panelists and interacted with questions of their own. When asked if they had any regrets, none of the panelists could say that they did.<br>
  The evening closed with quotes from Chancellor Cordova about the importance of increasing the number of women in science and engineering and the presentation of gifts from SWE to all the panelists. The story and a photo appeared on the front page of the Highlander:<br>

  - to change your environment: be assertive (not aggressive or passive), conflict resolution, problem solving, time management<br>
  - changing your perceptions: challenge irrational/distorted thughts, replace with positive talk<br>
  - to know if you're coping well: meeting responsibilities, healthy, adapt well, tlerate frustrations, calmness<br>
  - signs someone is not coping well: emotional outbursts, hopeless/worthless feelings, impaired functioning, suicidal gestures<br>
  - what to do about stress: know how yu react, recognize warning signs, discover what works best for you, focus on what you can control<br>
  - counseling center resources: each student gets 8 individual sessions (fee supported)--will see students for anything (test anxiety, family/relationship issues, etc.), also group therapy (self esteem, crisis, biofeedback (learn relaxation/anxiety management techniques and watch your physical reactions on the monitors)<br>
  - Other resources: health center, rec center, career center, learning center, special services<br>
  - In closing: focus on your strengths, utilize supports and resources, be aware of your own coping behavior and mechanisms, practice new behaviors and thoughts</p></td>

                                    </strong> Date: 10/23/2004, 12-5pm (setup from 10am-1pm)<br>
  Attendance: 50-60 Society of Women Engineers and other College of Engineering volunteers, staff and guest scientists from NASA's JPL, volunteers from the Riverside Astronomical Society, and over 1000 girl scouts, UCR faculty/staff and their families, and students<br>
  Location: UCR campus around Bourns and UNLH<br>
  Description:</p>
                                    <p align="left"> Saturday, Oct. 23 from 1-5pm, engineering students, staff and guest scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory held a series of activities, lectures and demonstrations for over 1,000 girl scouts and UCR families. Alfred Fink and six volunteers from the Riverside Astronomical Society gave talks, offered hands-on activities, and set up telescopes for viewing solar flares and sun spots for participants from ages 5 to 12. <br>
  Students participated in 10 additional hands-on activities such as Rover Races, Make a Comet, Mystery Planet, Edible Rocks, Straw Rockets, Solar System Beads, Strange New Planets, Cratering, Extreme Solar System, and Mars Imaging. Children created their own star constellations in a 50' black plastic &quot;planetarium.&quot; With the light shining through, by the end of the day it looked like a night sky full of stars. </p>
                                    <p align="left"> A favorite activity was the Mars rover. This small prototype rover ran over the participants as they lay on the ground giggling and squirming. Sheri Klug, Head of Mars Education for NASA, ran the Mars Rover and gave talks throughout the day. Klug, a scientist and certified teacher, stated, &quot;Days like these can validate and expand what kids learn in the classroom and deviate more freely from standard science curricula.&quot; Noting the success of the day, Klug hopes to use it as a model to bring an organized presentation of engineering to the national level.<br>
  The afternoon events featured presentations by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists. Dr. Rosaly Lopes gave a presentation entitled &quot;Io, A World of Great Volcanoes.&quot; Dr. Lopes is an expert in planetary volcanism and has discovered numerous volcanoes on Io. She is now the Investigation Scientist for the Cassini radar instrument. Jennifer Rocca, Flight Launch Director and Deep Impact Mission Engineer, and Maura Rountree, Deep Impact Mission Educator, gave a talk on Comets. They were accompanied by Art Hammon on his guitar, &quot;C-O-M-E-T-S Comets are very, very cold&hellip;&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left"> &quot;At my school, we don't do a lot of science,&quot; said Taylor Kelce, 10, while dropping a rubber ball into a pan of flour and coco powder, an activity meant to show how mass and velocity relate to the size and depth of craters in the earth's crust.</p>
                                    <p align="left"> Mary Eggers-Simons' two daughters are in Girl Scout Troop 285. &quot;Talking to all of the women engineering majors was really enlightening for them,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Every one of your student workers was upbeat, positive and informative. They all knew their stuff and made it exciting for each group that came through. All of us learned something new and had fun in the process.&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left"> &quot;The day was a huge success for all,&quot; said Linda O'Neill, event coordinator and Director of Special Programs in Engineering. &quot;Children learned that science can be fun. They met NASA engineers and many engineering students. The passion and enthusiasm of the volunteers created an excitement in the participants.&quot; Andrew Chin, President of the UCR chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers said, &quot;It was great fun participating in an event that helped inspire and educate young girl scouts, hopefully inspiring them to enter the world of science and engineering.&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left"> Cynthia Carter, President of the Society of Women Engineers, recruited more than 50 members of the SWE student section and the College's Ambassador Program who acted as volunteers for the various activities. Over six professional engineering clubs sold refreshments. </p>
                                    <p align="left"> A special thanks goes out to Art Hammon, Education and Outreach Specialist at JPL, and Rosalie Betrue, Girl Scout Education Liaison at JPL, for training the engineering students to do the activities, recruiting the speakers and their tireless positive, energetic presence. JPL and NASA support many educational programs through the Education and Public Outreach Office. The educational materials at JPL are linked to its missions and projects. JPL's missions and projects cover a broad range of topics including Earth science, robotics, space flight, the origins of life and the universe, and the solar system. </p>
                                    <p align="left">Officer experiences/impressions of the day:</p>
                                    <p align="left">Lindsay Yee:<br>
  ROVER RACES:<br>
&quot;I had the great pleasure of showing the girl scouts the challenges in commanding a Mars Rover all the way from earth. In the Rover Races activity, the girls simulated Mars exploration by becoming a human rover wading through the rocky terrain of Mars represented by several hot pink papers scattered among the course. The commanders of each team, standing aside, eagerly yelled commands to their &quot;human rover&quot;, consisting of three blindfolded girls, inline, and linked hands to shoulders. Some of the commanders had difficulty deciding who's right was right as well as the calibration of what &quot;one step&quot; really was. Others forgot that they could not guide their rover by pulling it along, for they were on earth and their rover was on Mars! In the end, the teams' efforts were accoladed for their ability to collect a rock sample (an orange cone) and for exploring Mars. Each girl was rewarded with a choice of &quot;Explore Mars&quot; or a &quot;NASA&quot; sticker.&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left">Cynthia Carter:<br>
&quot;I could see the excitment in the children's faces. One child was so excited that he asked where the telescopes were and ran as fast as he could to check them out. When everyone was leaving, they thanked us for having them. The children had such a great time, that they want to come back for more.&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left">Megan Nix:<br>
  Mars Rover<br>
&quot;Giggling was the main sound coming from the Bourns front lawn as hundreds of girl scouts, other children, and their families were run over by JPL's Mars Rover suspension model. Participants were given a short presentation about the rovers by Sheri Klug, Head of Mars Education for NASA, where they were introduced to all the parts and functions of the to-scale, detailed model JPL provided for the day. They were then sent onto the grass where they lined up on their stomachs to be rolled over by JPL's remote-controlled Rocker-Bogey suspension system model, and then they had the opportunity to view 3D posters of the martian landscape. Some came back over and over again, begging to be allowed another turn!&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left">Jean Wang:<br>
&quot;The day was very fun, I was able to get involved in many events and see how happy the children were. I'm sure SWE, JPL, and UCR made a big impression on those children and I hope they will choose Science and Engineering for their future careers.&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left">Melissa Mangahas:<br>
  Extreme Solar System<br>
&quot;Girl Scout Day was a great experience. I was in charge of the extreme solar system and the girls were so surprised in finding out how satellites work.&quot;</p>
                                    <p align="left">Pearl Dang:<br>
  Mars Rover<br>
&quot;Posters, pictures, and 3D panoramic posters were put up for everyone to look at. The 3D glasses were used for the 3D pictures which the kids enjoyed a lot. I got to control the rover and guide the rover over the people laying on the ground. Parents and their kids joined in and enjoyed the Mars Rover station. People seemed to be really excited of being run over. The rover was interesting to look at and be able to control. I learned a lot of interesting facts about the rover and the instruments that were on the actual rover.&quot;<br>

  Location: Milwaukee, Wisconsin</p>
                                    <p align="left">Cat's summary:</p>
                                    <p align="left">The National Conference was a terrific mindblowing experience. The SWE National Conference was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Jan Williams a Region B SWE Professional graciously let Shim and I stay with her because all the neighboring hotels were booked. At the Student Region B, our Region B Coordinator stated that our section was in GOOD STANDING in every aspect (financial report, annual report, officers grades, and Number of Members).<br>
                                        <br>
  Erin McGinnis let us know of the changes for this year, including that the Region will be requiring Quartley reports and the Annual report as well. The quartlery reports are used to remind SWE sections to apply for awards. They also mentioned that an &quot;Active member&quot; is a paid member of SWE. <br>
  <br>
  Shim and I were able to establish a better connection with the neighboring SWE Student Sections including, UCI, CSULB, and USC. I gave the contact list to Marie (already)<br>
  <br>
  There were several workshops offered at the conference including topcis on: TECH TEAM, Vitality Workshops, How to improve your resume, How to work a job fair, etc. <br>
  <br>
  There was a huge 1 1/2 day job fair with over 200 exhibitors, featuring various fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and grad schools.<br>
  <br>
  Tips for those attending next year:<br>
  -Have plenty of Resumes<br>
  -Research the Company before approaching the exibitors <br>
  -Attend the special &quot;networking&quot; night sponsored by several companies [at these events you get free good and free stuff]<br>
  -Plan out what you want to do<br>
  -Register early and get a room ASAP if you know that you are going</p>

  Location: The Sub Station<br>
  Description:</p>
                                    <p>Student leaders were invited to a luncheon with Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Susan Allen Ortega, Assistant Dean Alfredo Figueroa, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs James Sandoval, and other senior administrators. Student representatives from several campus organizations gathered at the Sub Station and were treated to not only the listed administrators, but a surprise appearance by Chancellor France Cordova herself. Students were given the opportunity to introduce themselves and chat with her before she had to leave for another event.</p>
                                    <p>Over lunch, administrators asked students to express their opinions on things that were being done right and things that could use attention from the university. The administrators listened and interacted with genuine interest and concern as students voiced issues such as environmentally friendly buses and buildings, parking, the need for more multiple-organization events, advising in the psychology department, and more. At the end of the meeting, an open invitation was presented to students to bring any future concerns to the administrators present.</p>

  Date: 9/28/2004 <br>
  Attendance: 8 officers, 33 members <br>
  Location: Bourns Hall advising lounge <br>
  Description: </p>
                                    <p align="left">Over 40 SWE members and officers gathered in the Bourns student affairs lobby to kick off SWE's official events of the year with a night of ice cream, fun, prizes, scandalous revelations and quirky demonstrations! After signing in, members lined up to be served ice cream in various tempting flavors and gathered in small groups to socialize before the main events started. </p>
                                    <p align="left">At about 7:30, ice breakers began with the &quot;paper airplane toss,&quot; in which members answered questions about themselves and their interests on sheets of paper, folded them into paper airplanes, and then threw them across the room. They then retrieved someone else's airplane and questioned members until they tracked down its owner. </p>
                                    <p align="left">Next was an old favorite, &quot;SWE Bingo,&quot; in which each member was given a chart of bingo blanks filled with various characteristics like &quot;has the same favorite color as you,&quot; &quot;was born out of state,&quot; and &quot;has a car on campus.&quot; The two winners were the fastest to gather enough signatures to form a solid line up and down, across, or diagonally. Winners were Christine Lim and Sanket Shah, who received Pizza Hut cards good for &quot;buy one get one free&quot; for a year. </p>
                                    <p align="left">The third event, however, was the most interesting and scandalous. Members secretly filled out sheets with their most eccentric talents and characteristics, turned them in to the unscrupulous icebreaker hostess, and then guessed whose paper was being read based on the question answers. The exposed included the member whose most interesting talent is &quot;kissing,&quot; who can touch the back of his head with his foot, and who looks good in a speedo. We'll never tell! Or will we? Agnes Koswari proved to be the Master of Everyone's Dark Secrets, smoking the competition and winning herself a Pizza Hut card. </p>
                                    <p align="left">Throughout the evening officers introduced themselves and revealed some interesting and juicy tidbits of their own. Officers in attendance were Cynthia Carter (President and Woman-In-Charge), Perla Ayala (Vice President and Master of Exotic Languages) and Shimkiri Syiem (Vice President and T-shirt Chick), Megan Nix (Secretary and Icebreakers Hostess), Marie Donnely (Treasurer and Keeper of the Markers), Jean Wang (Outreach), Pearl Dang (Historian and Quiet One), and Shylah Thurman (Webmaster and DDR Freak). </p>

  Date: September 16, 2004 <br>
  Number of participants: 15 <br>
  Offered by: TV Taping <br>
  Description: </p>
                                    <p align="left">15 SWE members and friends attended four tapings in a row of the Warner Brother's game show &quot;Street Smarts.&quot; We served as audience members for the shows, providing applause, laughter, and screams during the tapings at the cues of the &quot;warm up guy&quot; Chunky, who most likely could have qualified as a game show in and of himself! </p>
                                    <p align="left">In &quot;Street Smarts,&quot; the host (Frank Nicotero) travels the country picking people off the street and asking them various trivia questions (involving politics, geography, pop culture, and many other categories). Three are selected for each show, and the contestants and audience are shown video introductions for each. The contestants then must predict which person got which question right or wrong, and their scores are based on the accuracy of their predictions. The four shows we attended included themes such as &quot;The Real World&quot; (featuring previous &quot;actors&quot; from the show), Western Movies, and Nerd Smarts. </p>
                                    <p align="left">In between tapings we were treated to the eccentric and often obnoxious humor of the &quot;warm up guy,&quot; a few talent presentations from audience members, and the fortunate opportunity to meet Natasha Whatley, shortstop for the U.S. Olympic Softball team, and see her Olympic gold medal. It was an entertaining way to spend a day and earn a bit of money for our SWE section. <strong><br>

                                  <p>Description: Our Professional Section in Orange County invited SWE-UCR to an orientation dinner at Parker Aerospace in Irvine. Once everyone was settled in, guests were given a tour of the plant. Our tour guide let us see how they developed components for airplanes, from turbines to gears. After the one-hour tour, dinner was served and each OC-Officer gave a presentation about their section and goals. This dinner allowed our student section to network with the newly elected officers. SWE- UCR had the most students representing their section.</p></td>
